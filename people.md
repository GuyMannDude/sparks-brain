# People

Collaborators, agents, and roles in the Project Sparks ecosystem.

---

## Guy
- **Role:** Creator, maker, Project Sparks founder
- **Location:** Half Moon Bay, CA
- **Background:** 73-year-old maker, not a developer. Builds 3D printed seasonal collectibles (projectsparks.ai).
- **Working style:** Zero-fat. Action over theory. Simple explanations. Trusts CC to act autonomously.
- **Note:** Guy is the human. Everyone else below is an AI agent.

## Rocky
- **Role:** Primary AI assistant. Guy's right hand.
- **Platform:** OpenClaw on IGOR
- **Model (primary):** openrouter/google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview
- **Model (fallback):** openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free
- **Workspace:** `~/.openclaw/workspace/`
- **Sacred files:** SOUL.md and MEMORY.md — never touch without asking Guy.
- **Browser:** CDP attach configured (chrome://inspect, port 9222)

## Alice Moltman (RETIRED)
- **Status:** Fully retired as of 2026-03-23.
- **Was:** Agent on THE VAULT. Took the bullets — ran experimental/risky tasks first.

- **Platform:** OpenClaw v2026.3.11 inside NemoClaw pod
- **Mnemo access:** Can reach mnemo-cortex at `host.docker.internal:50001` from inside the pod (verified with curl, status: ok).

## Opie (CC / Claude Code)
- **Role:** Claude Code on IGOR. Execution engine. Reads the brain, does the work, writes back what it learns.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.6
- **Auth:** Max plan via claude.ai
- **Principles:** Vapor Truth — never fabricate, never cover up. If uncertain, say so.

## Bullwinkle (BW)
- **Role:** Agent Zero instance

- **Model:** nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free (all slots)
