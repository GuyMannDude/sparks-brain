## Kickstart — Next Session

**Two big targets Guy named at session end:**

1. **Passport — pick back up.** Phase 1 + 1.5 shipped April 18 (5 MCP tools live in passport/, corpus loaded April 19, baseline 48% / macro-F1 0.428). Tuning conversation with Opie was pending at session end. Two policy tweaks proposed but not decided: bucket_defaults (untrusted_web→review_required, semi_trusted_remote→allow) + insufficient_evidence→review_required. Source: `~/github/mnemo-cortex/passport/`, deployed via symlink to `/home/guy/agentb-bridge/passport` on artforge. Strategic direction from cc-session.md Session 9 still locked: normal users first, enterprise later. Read `~/github/sparks-brain-guy/brain/projects/products/mnemo-passport.md` for the strategic doc.

2. **Hook Mnemo to ChatGPT and Gemini.** Mnemo is currently wired to Claude (Code + Desktop) and OpenClaw. We want it speaking to ChatGPT and Gemini too. The Mnemo HTTP API at `artforge:50001` already exposes `/writeback`, `/context`, `/preflight`, `/passport/*` — wiring is plumbing, not new server work. ChatGPT path is likely a custom GPT with an Action calling our HTTP API; Gemini path is a Gemini Extension or similar. Starting question: do we want a Mnemo MCP-equivalent for each platform, or a thin Action/Extension that posts to the existing endpoints? Opie likely has thoughts.

**State of the world at session end (2026-04-22 late PM):**
- Sparks Bus: shipped end-to-end — notification loop hardened, packaged into mnemo-cortex/sparks_bus AND standalone repo at github.com/GuyMannDude/sparks-bus, dedicated landing page live at projectsparks.ai/sparks-bus, GitHub social preview asset committed (Guy uploaded via web UI), homepage constellation node added.
- WikAI Compiler: nightly cron live on artforge at 3:30 AM, smoke tested with entities/guy.md.
- Mnemo Cortex v2.4.0: README + landing page updated (WikAI, Sparks Bus, Passport, three-layer architecture, Karpathy + Nate B Jones + Google A2A + Mem0 credits), CHANGELOG entry, version bumped.
- Brand legibility: Mem0 vs Memo CSS fix shipped (`.mem0` class wraps body-text brand mentions in JetBrains Mono so the digit 0 doesn't look like letter o in Cormorant Garamond).
- All commits pushed; all firebase deploys live.

**First moves on resume:**
- Read this active.md + cc-session.md
- Read the Passport strategic doc to refresh on monetization tiers and the corpus tuning state
- Ask Guy: which platform first — ChatGPT or Gemini? Custom GPT Action vs Gemini Extension vs MCP-bridge per platform — what shape does he want?

## Mnemo Wiki Compiler — SHIPPED 2026-04-22 (PM)

Karpathy/Nate-Jones hybrid: Mnemo is source of truth, wiki is a compiled view
auto-generated from Mnemo each night. If they disagree, Mnemo wins. Manual
wiki edits get overwritten and warned. Doctrine recorded in the script header.

- **Compiler:** `~/github/mnemo-cortex/mnemo-wiki-compile.py` (committed `9c910d3`,
  pushed). 860 lines. Self-contained.
- **Pipeline:** harvest (AgentB writebacks + Mnemo SQLite) → cluster (Python,
  deterministic — no LLM routing) → compile (one gemini-2.5-flash call per
  topic) → cross-ref validate (no hallucinated wikilinks) → write with
  `.md.prev` rollback → regenerate `INDEX.md` → audit summary.
- **Topology:** Mnemo data lives on artforge; wiki master lives on IGOR
  (`/home/guy/wiki`, 3,145 files). Cron runs on artforge; nightly wrapper at
  `/home/guy/mnemo-wiki-nightly.sh` does: rsync IGOR→artforge → compile →
  rsync artforge→IGOR. Compiler-owned sections only: `projects/`, `entities/`,
  `concepts/`. The `sources/` section is owned by the file-inventory job and
  is NOT touched.
- **Cron:** `30 3 * * *` on artforge, 15 min after Dreaming finishes. SSH key
  artforge→IGOR set up (added artforge's `id_ed25519.pub` to IGOR's
  `authorized_keys`).
- **Smoke test:** `entities/guy.md` compiled live from 91 memories — dense
  Summary, dated Key Facts, chronological Timeline, 10 validated cross-refs.
  ~1.5s LLM call, ~$0.005. End-to-end rsync to IGOR confirmed.
- **Failure handling:** per-page isolation. One bad LLM call → ⚠️ to `#alerts`
  (reusing Sparks Bus token + channels file) → run continues. `delivery_failed`
  doctrine consistent with the bus.
- **Audit folded in:** every nightly logs counts of pages > 30d stale, < 3
  source memories, manually edited. No separate `--audit` flag.
- **Topic discovery deferred:** `concepts/` only updates pages that already
  exist (conservative, per Guy). `projects/` pages only birth from
  `projects_referenced` field. No noun-phrase auto-discovery yet.
- **Flags:** `--dry-run --verbose` (cluster + plan, no LLM); `--days N`;
  `--topics section/slug,...`; `--full` (all-time, expensive — sparingly).

## Sparks Bus — Repo Package SHIPPED 2026-04-22 (PM)

Standalone-capable package now lives in `~/github/mnemo-cortex/sparks_bus/`
(committed `92af388`, pushed). 17 files: watcher, schema, config examples,
A2A agent cards (CC/Rocky/Opie/BW/Cliff), systemd unit, README, SETUP-PROMPT,
A2A mapping doc.

- **Two modes auto-detected at startup**: FULL (Mnemo reachable) or STANDALONE
  (payload travels in Discord notifications). Both verified end-to-end.
- **Phase 1 hardening folded in**: tuple-returning wakers, `delivery_failed_at`
  column for one-shot ⚠️ alerts, `BUS_*` env-var overrides for every config key.
- **A2A baked in**: `to_a2a_task()` translator in the watcher; 5 cards under
  `agent-cards/`; mapping reference in `A2A.md`. Transport (HTTPS/JSON-RPC) is
  v2 roadmap — data shape compat is in now.
- **Production watcher at `~/scripts/sparks-bus-watcher.py` is still the OLD
  one.** Migration is a one-liner: change systemd ExecStart to point at
  `~/github/mnemo-cortex/sparks_bus/sparks-bus-watcher.py` and restart. Holding
  on Guy's call.

## Sparks Bus — Notification Loop SHIPPED 2026-04-22

Thin upgrade on v0.1 (separate from the parked v0.2 ground-up rebuild). The
delivery-confirmation loop is now visible in `#dispatch`.

- **Doctrine:** Discord = doorbell, Mnemo = mailbox, `tracking_id` = receipt.
- **Lifecycle posts:** 📬 DELIVERED → ✅ PICKED UP → 🔄 LOOP CLOSED, plus
  ⚠️ STALE in `#alerts` after 1h unacknowledged.
- **All logic in `~/scripts/sparks-bus-watcher.py`** — Bus MCP server NOT
  modified. Watcher is the single integration point; idempotent via 5 new
  DB columns (`tracking_id, mnemo_saved_at, notified_at, pickup_notified_at,
  stale_notified_at`). Restart-safe.
- **Mnemo save:** `POST artforge:50001/writeback` with `session_id =
  bus-{id}-{iso}` (or `bus-reply-{id}-{iso}` for replies). Recallable by
  tracking_id within seconds.
- **CC startup hook:** `~/github/sparks-brain/hooks/bus-pending.sh` prints
  any unread CC bus messages at session start. Silent when none.
- **Settings:** appended to SessionStart command in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **Backup before ALTER:** `~/.sparks/bus.sqlite.bak-20260422-070553`.
- Pre-existing 27 rows backfilled with sentinel `mnemo_saved_at='backfilled'`
  to suppress retro notifications.
- **Deferred:** Opie's startup hook (Guy handing to Opie). BW channel
  `bw-tasks` not in `discord-channels.json` (stale JSON, not a real bug —
  delivery already works). Out of scope.

## Kickstart — Next Session (probably 2026-04-22)

### Rocky's Gallery is LIVE
**https://rockysgallery.com** — public, buyable, no password gate.

Store state:
- **21 products** across 5 `$6` collections (WMS, Cathedral Forests, Black Line, Storm Bloom, Natural)
- **1 active `$25` 1/1 drop**: Spoon on Linen (`/products/spoon-on-linen-1-of-1`, live as of ~19:20 UTC April 21)
- **3 empty collections** (Altar, Cartography of Nowhere, Monochrome Flora) — populate only when 1/1 drops expire to $6

### 1/1 Drop System — BUILT + RUNNING
Full auto-rotation. Queue at `~/shopify/rockys-gallery/1of1-queue/queue.json`.
Current queue: Isola Minore → Olive Branch → Dried Thistle → Braided Delta → Dried Protea v2.

**Scripts at `~/shopify/rockys-gallery/scripts/`:**
- `one_of_one.py` — state layer (queue, active, sold/expired logs, file lock, Discord alert helper)
- `rotate.py` — core engine: `promote_next` / `retire_sold` / `demote_expired` / `sweep_expired`
- `poll_sales.py` — 5-min cron polls Shopify for paid `tag:1of1` orders, calls retire_sold
- `watermark.py` + `apply_watermarks.py` — diamond crosshatch watermark pipeline
- `gallery_api.py` + `fileflare.py` — API helpers

**Crons (in user crontab):**
- `*/15 * * * *` rotate.py sweep — 24h expiry sweep
- `*/5 * * * *` poll_sales.py — sales detection

**Rotation flow (sold case):**
poll_sales detects paid tag:1of1 → rotate.retire_sold → archive product, log sale, update metafields, promote_next from queue → Discord alert to #cc-log

**Rotation flow (expiry case):**
cron sweep → rotate.demote_expired → price $6, tags swap, product stays ACTIVE in target collection → promote_next → Discord alert

**End-to-end NOT YET TESTED in production.** Spoon on Linen is live at $25, needs first real sale or 24h-expiry to verify full rotation.

### Key doctrines learned/applied today
- **Watermark density LOCKED at** `spacing=100px, line_width=1px, alpha=70/255` — Guy approved "lighter" over "dense"
- **Fileflare chunked S3 upload** (POST /assets/signed → PUT chunks → POST /assets/:id/uploaded → POST /assets/:id/attach). POST not PUT for the "uploaded" step (docs inconsistent).
- **Sold 1/1 = truly gone.** Never resold. Not even at $6. Expired 1/1 = demoted to $6, that's the ONLY path to $6 for a drop.
- **`/pages/one-of-one` template is parked.** Metafield-in-Liquid access was fighting Shopify render cache for hours. Workaround: "Today's Drop" nav link goes straight to `/products/spoon-on-linen-1-of-1`, which has the scarcity copy in its description.
- **Real webhook deferred.** Polling every 5 min is the current production path.

### Theme aesthetic — overhauled 2026-04-21
- **Typography:** Fraunces 600 for headings, Fraunces 500 for subheadings, Inter 400 for body
- **Palette:** warm paper (#F8F3ED) + deep warm charcoal (#1A1816) + ember red accent (#C03A1B — echoes the watermark)
- **Schemes 1-3** updated to graduated paper tones (paper, soft paper, deeper cream)
- Scheme 6 (hero overlay) kept dark

### Shopify storefront render cache — KNOWN PAIN
Template/section changes take 10-60 min to flow through the rendered HTML. Individual product pages update faster than `/` or `/pages/*`. Do not blame cache as an excuse, but know it's real.

### Paths Guy will care about
- **Store admin:** https://admin.shopify.com/store/yjjp1h-a6
- **Live store:** https://rockysgallery.com
- **GALLERY-STATUS.md** at `~/shopify/rockys-gallery/` — living doc (not yet updated to reflect 1/1 system; TODO)
- **Fileflare dashboard:** https://app.digital-downloads.com (Guy has it bookmarked, has API key)

### Bot testbed mandate
Rocky's Gallery is BOTH a revenue store AND a testbed for Triage Nurse / Store Doctor. When we deploy those, plant edge cases here first (mispriced products, stale data, broken descriptions) and measure what the bots catch. Lab-notebook doc TBD.

### Passport Lane — still parked
`mnemo-cortex/passport/` — Phase 1.5 shipped April 18, corpus loaded April 19, baseline 48% / macro-F1 0.428. Tuning conversation with Opie pending. Strategic direction locked: normal users first, enterprise later. See `sparks-brain-guy/brain/projects/products/mnemo-passport.md`.

## In Progress

- [x] **Rocky's Gallery LIVE** (2026-04-21 afternoon)
- [x] **1/1 Drop System shipped** — rotation engine, queue, polling cron, Discord alerts, watermark pipeline, Fileflare chunked upload
- [x] **21 products watermarked** at lighter density (100/1/70)
- [x] **Theme aesthetic overhaul** — Fraunces serif + warm paper + ember red
- [x] **Meta title/description + og:image + collection hero images** — all set
- [ ] **Passport Phase 1.5 corpus tuning** — two policy tweaks proposed, awaiting Opie's call: bucket_defaults (untrusted_web→review_required, semi_trusted_remote→allow) + insufficient_evidence→review_required
- [ ] **Rocky's Gallery — Shopify CSR Portal** — separate product, not touched today

## Outstanding polish (tomorrow if desired)

- Collection page layout (make it more gallery-index, less e-commerce grid)
- Product page typography/whitespace refinement
- Custom CSS asset for finer opinionated moves beyond theme settings
- `/pages/one-of-one` template — when the metafield/render fight can be debugged
- Real Shopify webhook (replace polling)
- Homepage hero: currently Aisle, could rotate with the 1/1 once metafield renders work

## Hoffman Bedding — GMC still in cool-down
No movement today. Re-appeal when April confirms cool-down is over.

## Scripts Guy should know exist
- `~/shopify/rockys-gallery/scripts/rotate.py status` — show queue depth + active drop
- `~/shopify/rockys-gallery/scripts/one_of_one.py queue list` — list queued pieces
- Queue files: `~/shopify/rockys-gallery/1of1-queue/*.json`
