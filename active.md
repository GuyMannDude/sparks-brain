What's happening right now. Current work, priorities, blockers, next actions.

## In Progress
- [ ] **Hoffman Bedding — Google Merchant Center** — GMC suspended (not dead). All product/site fixes COMPLETE. Waiting for cool-down period to end before re-appeal. April tracking the timeline.
- [ ] **Stripe publishable key** — Guy needs to grab pk_live_ from dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
- [ ] **Sparky Mnemo blocked** — NemoClaw openshell proxy returns 403 on non-TLS internal endpoints. Issue filed: NVIDIA/NemoClaw#1551. Sparky updated to OpenClaw 2026.4.5 but can't reach Mnemo.
- [x] **Sparks Bus v0.1** — MCP message broker for inter-agent communication. SQLite-backed (separate from Mnemo). Auto-wake watcher daemon delivers messages to all agents. Full round-trip proven.
- [x] **Discord wiring** — All 5 agents on Discord. Channel discipline set. Unified bot (CC+Opie) on systemd. Rocky locked to rocky-log/dispatch/alerts/discoveries only.
- [x] **Peter Widget 3 bugs** — Stale knowledge (retired product rules), mnemo retry with backoff, hiccup loop fixed.
- [x] **Mnemo Cortex v2.3.2** — Doc audit: dead Google model name (text-embedding-004→gemini-embedding-001), troubleshooting section, expected test output.

## Up Next
- [ ] **OpenClaw update 2026.4.8 → 2026.4.11** — Active Memory plugin, agent failover fix, Ollama cache, security hardening. Run `openclaw doctor --fix` after. Daytime job — needs Rocky restart.
- [ ] Chat Portal deployment (after Stripe key)
- [ ] Sparks Bus v0.2 — bus_subscribe (standing interest), message TTL
- [ ] Mem0 bridge production deploy (code exists, needs pip install on THE VAULT)
- [ ] Hoffman Bedding re-appeal (waiting on GMC cool-down end date from April)
- [ ] Bulk image alt text for Hoffman (723 images, 0% have alt — big SEO win)

## Blocked
- **Heartbeat re-enable:** Resolved — heartbeat running on Nemotron free tier (1h interval)
- **Sparky Mnemo:** Needs NVIDIA/NemoClaw#1551 fix or workaround
