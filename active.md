## In Progress
- [x] **Sparky gateway fix** — DONE. Both issues resolved:
  1. Pod→mnemo-cortex: added network policy preset + UFW rule
  2. Device identity: synced /sandbox/ identity to /root/, restarted gateway. RPC probe: ok.
- [ ] **Heartbeat cost leak fix** — Cron heartbeat defaulting to Gemini Pro (~$2.40/day). Needs per-session model override.
- [ ] **Rocky OpenClaw update** — IGOR at v2026.3.13, update to v2026.3.22 pending green light

## Up Next
- [ ] NemoClaw network policy preset — drop-in YAML to allow pod→host traffic (port 50001)
- [ ] Verify NemoClaw sandbox health on THE VAULT (`nemoclaw sparks-nemo status`)
- [ ] Test browser fix that was pending before this session

## Blocked
- ~~Sparky↔Mnemo: RESOLVED — policy preset + UFW rule applied~~
- **Heartbeat:** Needs OpenClaw per-session model override feature to force cron jobs to free tier.

## Notes
- Alice is retired. Sparky (in NemoClaw pod) now fills the experimental agent role.
- Sparky is CLI-only — no gateway, no Telegram.
- Sparks Router v0.6.0 active on IGOR (localhost:8100). Smart/Utility→Gemini Pro, Free→Nemotron.
- Testing frameworks at `~/github/mnemo-cortex/tests/ongoing/` and `~/github/sparks-router/tests/ongoing/`
- Legacy Gemini 3.1 Pro image model removed from THE VAULT config.
