## Kickstart — Next Session (2026-04-20)

### Rocky's Gallery — CC has creative ownership
Guy's words April 19: *"It is your site to design however. Display however. Add pages.
Keep building as we go. Maybe my 3D creations later. Have fun CC. Your site."*

**Current state:**
- Domain rockysgallery.com LIVE (Shopify-managed, SSL, primary flipped, support@ email forwarding)
- Password page rendering new WMS hero (`hero-wms-v1.png`, OpenAI-generated)
- Andre's attribution removed until his hi-res photos surface
- ComfyUI pipeline on IGOR-2 PROVEN: Flux.1-schnell-fp8 + 4x-UltraSharp, ~60s per print-ready 6144×4096 output
- **13 pieces generated across 3 collections** — see `~/shopify/rockys-gallery/GALLERY-STATUS.md`
  - Where Machines Sleep (5): Aisle, Patch, Tower, Cabinet, Landing
  - Cathedral Forests (4): Vertical, Understory, Canopy, Mist
  - Black Line (4): Tree, Wave, Ridge, Branch
- All files at `~/shopify/rockys-gallery/inventory/cc-generated/`

**First thing Guy sees tomorrow:** 13 images to scroll. If aesthetic holds, CC continues
with Storm Bloom (maximalist) + begins actual Shopify site design.

**Fulfillment decisions locked:**
- NO Prodigi (Guy had bad assembly experience)
- YES Printful for poster sizes + Digital downloads primary
- Pricing target: $6 digital / ~$28-$75 Printful retail

### Passport Lane corpus — awaiting Guy + Opie decision
- AL's 200-example corpus landed at `~/github/mnemo-cortex/tests/passport/corpus/`
- Schema adapter (`corpus_migrate.py`) bridges v0 names → Phase 1 names
- Baseline: 48% accuracy, macro-F1 0.428
- `hard_block` F1=0.745 (detectors work), `allow` F1=0.269 (bucket floor too aggressive)
- Two tunings proposed — Guy + Opie's call tomorrow before Karpathy loop kicks off
- sparks-router-v2 PR #3 CLOSED with thank-you to AL

### Windows ComfyUI
- Patched `C:\Projects\ComfyUI\app\logger.py` to swallow `[Errno 22]` on flush
- Backup at `logger.py.bak-pre-errno22-patch`
- Launch command used: `python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0` from `C:\Projects\ComfyUI`
- Currently running headless via SSH Start-Process

### Still parked
- **Passport Phase 1.5 vs Opie** — whether the two tunings (bucket_defaults, insufficient_evidence→review) get applied
- **"Running nurse"** health check for Opie MCP tools
- **Opie context gap** — opie.md doesn't yet mention Passport Lane or Gallery generation pipeline
- **Guy's 3D creations** as future gallery collection
